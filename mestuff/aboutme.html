    <p id="school" class="aboutme">
        I am an 18 year old computing student from Scotland. Currently working
        towards my Masters of computing science at St. Andrews University
        which I hope to graduate from in 2025.

    <p id="freetime" class="aboutme">
      In my free time I enjoy playing chess and working on small programs such
      as a chess solver which I posted on my <a href="https://github.com/ObnoxiousOrk/Maze-solver">Github</a>.
      I usually work in python, but have recently expaned out and dabbled in C++,
      and also need to use Java for Uni projects.
